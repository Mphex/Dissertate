This work---the dissertation and all work associated with it---is dedicated to my wife, CarolAnn, who supported and motivated me throughout the many years of school, making the process about much more than simply obtaining a degree. She provided the drive to continue forward during the difficult times. Her smile and laugh provided a more balanced perspective. I will always be grateful to her and for her. I also dedicate this work to my children, who patiently loved a father who was often busy working, even when at home. Finally, I dedicate this work to my parents and siblings, who kept me level-headed throughout the process, providing wise and thoughtful advice.

This work is truly evidence of the love I am surrounded by.
